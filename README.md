# Twitch API Project

A simple exercise in using the Twitch API. Obtains twitch streamer information and displays it in list format, dependant on whether or not they are online. Does not yet contain database functionality.

>**User Story:** I can see whether Free Code Camp is currently streaming on Twitch.tv.<br>
>**User Story:** I can click the status output and be sent directly to the Free Code Camp's Twitch.tv channel.<br>
>**User Story:** If a Twitch user is currently streaming, I can see additional details about what they are streaming.<br>
>**User Story:** I will see a placeholder notification if a streamer has closed their Twitch account (or the account never existed). You can verify this works by adding brunofin and comster404 to your array of Twitch streamers.<br>
